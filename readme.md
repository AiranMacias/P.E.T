<h1>P.E.T<h1><h4>(Python ETL Tool)</h4>

I am building an etl tool that extract,transform and load all csv file in a given folder, PET.py should handle all the processed data to postgresql while data_processing.py should handle all data processing such as data cleaning, data manipulation etc.

How to use

-   make a data folder and put your csv's inside
-   run data_processing.py

<h2>Why I made this?</h2>
For fun and im trying to create a simple etl tool so all the data cleaning, data exploration etc. can be done on python and jupyter. you can fork and modify the code how you like
